    Description: This file defines a function which reads in
                 a DFA described in a file and builds an appropriate datastructure.

                 There is also another function which takes this DFA and a word
                 and returns if the word is accepted by the DFA.

                 It should be implemented for Exercise 3 of Assignment 0.

                 See the assignment notes for a description of its contents.

    """ This function reads the DFA in the specified file and returns a
        data structure representing it. It is up to you to choose an appropriate
        data structure. The returned DFA will be used by your accepts_word
        function. Consider using a tuple to hold the parts of your DFA, one of which
        might be a dictionary containing the edges.

        We suggest that you return a tuple containing the names of the start
        and accepting states, and a dictionary which represents the edges in
        the DFA.
